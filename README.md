# CaSGC Summer Internship 2022
## Overview 
This internship is part of the <a href="https://casgc.ucsd.edu/?page_id=7229">Calfornia Space Grant Consortium</a> and Hartnell College's <a href="https://hartnellstem.org/the-program/">STEM Internship<a> program. In this internship, students are placed into teams to use micro‐computers (Arduino or Raspberry Pi) to teach hardware, programming, robotics, logic, and teamwork.
## Project Abstract 
On long term space missions, astronauts may not always have a physician on board to monitor their health and with the potential of longer space missions, knowing the current health status of the astronauts is vital to make sure that they are able to withstand these long journeys. With multiple sensors on an astronaut’s body that are then connected to an Arduino, we take the measurements of an individual’s heart rate, ECG (electrocardiogram), blood oxygen levels, and their body temperature. The measurements are then sent to another Arduino that also takes the measurements of the humidity and temperature of the surrounding area. Using this data, a LCD Display connected to the second arduino will constantly display the live data as it continually takes in the measurements of the individual and the surrounding area. 

Having this data is crucial in ensuring that the health of the astronauts are not in decline and that themselves and others know of any drastic changes in their vitals. 

## Reference Projects
